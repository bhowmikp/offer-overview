# [OfferOverview](https://offer-overview-1a6b4.firebaseapp.com)

The goal of the app is to provide an interface to organize job offers. It provides a graphical representation so the user can decide which job offer is the best suited for them.

- Serverless Progressive Web App (PWA) written with Angular as the frontend, and Firebase Realtime Database as the NoSQL database
- Since the app is serverless it is highly scalable and due to Firebase it has a 99.95% uptime
- The app is set up in a way that it works offline and stores the data into the database once its connected to the internet
